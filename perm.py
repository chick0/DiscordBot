# Usage:
perm [get/set] [user/cmd] [list of user/commands to set permission] [0~5]

This command will manage the permission of command/user in this server. There's 7 permissions that are used by this bot:
* 0. disabled - This is only for commands.
* 1. botowner - Only the owner of the bot can recieve this permission.
* 2. svowner - Only the owner of the server can recieve this permission.
* 3. svmod
* 4. svsudoer
* 5. public - Default permission for people with no permissions
* 6. filter - This is only for the filter and can't be assigned manually.
* 9. blacklisted - This is only for users.
Only svmod or higher permissions can set the permission, and you can't change the permission if the target already has a higher permission than you or the permission you're trying to set is higher than you.
You can change the permisison of the command that has the same/lower permission, but you can't change the permission of the user who has the same permission with you.
